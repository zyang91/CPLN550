## Assignment 3

This is an R Markdown document for assignment 3 Transportation planning

### set work directory

```{r}
setwd("/Users/apple/Desktop/CPLN550")
```

### Require Packages
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
```

### Load Data
```{r}
hh <- read.csv("Data/1_Household_Public.csv")
per <- read.csv("Data/2_Person_Public.csv")
veh <- read.csv("Data/3_Vehicle_Public.csv")
trip <- read.csv("Data/4_Trip_Public.csv")
```

## Question 1

1)	Draw a random household from the second ten households in your data. 
Write a brief description of the household. Be sure to include their income, race, composition, county of residence, and whether they own a car.
```{r}
sort(unique(hh$HH_ID))[sample(11:20,1)]
```

```{r}
random <- hh %>%
  filter(HH_ID == 101162)

random_person <- per %>%
  filter(HH_ID == 101162)

print(random)
print(random_person)
```

## Question 2

2)	Describe the daily activities and travel of the household’s members using the trip data.   

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
random_trip <- trip %>%
  filter(HH_ID == 101162)

print(random_trip)
```
## Question 3

3)	Provide an estimate of the total number of bicycle trips represented by the survey data. 
```{r}
bike_trip <- trip %>%
  filter(MODE_AGG == 2) 
bike_trip %>%
  summarise(total_trips=sum(P_WEIGHT, na.rm=TRUE))
```
## Question 4

4)	Make a table that shows the mode choice for residents from the county of the household from question 1. 
```{r}
complet_trip <-left_join(hh, trip, by = "HH_ID")

H_trip <- complet_trip %>%
  filter(H_COUNTY== random$H_COUNTY)

H_trip_mode <- H_trip %>%
  filter(!is.na(MODE_AGG)) %>%
  group_by(MODE_AGG) %>%
  summarise(total_trips_by_mode=sum(P_WEIGHT, na.rm=TRUE))

H_tripPercentage <- H_trip_mode %>%
  mutate(percentage = total_trips_by_mode/sum(total_trips_by_mode)*100)

print(H_tripPercentage)
```
## Question 5

5)	Make a graphic that shows the relationship between household income and the age of a household’s vehicle for all households. 

```{r}
household <- left_join(hh, veh, by = "HH_ID")
 ## clean the data-removing income missing values
household <- household %>%
  filter(!INCOME %in% c(98, 99))
## Clean the data- removing the household do not have vehicle
household <- household %>%
  filter(TOT_VEH.y > 0)
## Clean the data- removing missing YEAR, changing the YEAR to Car age
household <- household %>%
  filter(!YEAR %in% c(9998, 9999))%>%
  mutate(VEHAGE= 2014- YEAR)
```
## boxplot
### Converted the income number into text
```{r}
household <-household %>%
  mutate(income= case_when(INCOME==1 ~ "Under $10,000",
                           INCOME==2 ~ "$10,000-$24,999",
                           INCOME==3 ~ "$25,000-$34,999",
                           INCOME==4 ~ "$35,000-$49,999",
                           INCOME==5 ~ "$50,000-$74,999",
                           INCOME==6 ~ "$75,000-$99,999",
                           INCOME==7 ~ "$100,000-$149,999",
                           INCOME==8 ~ "$150,000-$199,999",
                           INCOME==9 ~ "$200,000-$249,999",
                           INCOME==10 ~ "$250,000 or more"))
household$income <- factor(household$income, levels = c("Under $10,000", 
                                                        "$10,000-$24,999", 
                                                        "$25,000-$34,999",
                                                        "$35,000-$49,999", 
                                                        "$50,000-$74,999", 
                                                        "$75,000-$99,999",
                                                        "$100,000-$149,999", 
                                                        "$150,000-$199,999", 
                                                        "$200,000-$249,999", 
                                                        "$250,000 or more"))
ggplot(household, aes(x= income, y= VEHAGE))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  labs(title="Boxplot of Car Age by Household Income Level", 
       x="Income level", y= "Vehicle Age")
```
### without outlier- same boxplot with better visulization
```{r}
ggplot(household, aes(x = income, y = VEHAGE)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) +
  labs(
    title = "Boxplot of Car Age by Household Income Level",
    x = "Income level", y = "Vehicle Age")+
  ylim(0, 30)

```

## Question 6

6)	Make a table or graphic that shows the relationship between household income and mode choice for all households. 

```{r}
modechoice<-left_join(hh, trip, by = "HH_ID")

## clean the data-removing income missing values
modechoice <- modechoice %>%
  filter(!INCOME %in% c(98, 99))
## Clean the data- removing missing MODE_AGG
modechoice <- modechoice %>%
  filter(!is.na(MODE_AGG))

```

### plot
```{r}
modechoice <- modechoice %>%
  mutate(mode= case_when(MODE_AGG==1 ~ "Walk",
                             MODE_AGG==2 ~ "Bike",
                             MODE_AGG==3 ~ "Private Vehicle",
                             MODE_AGG==4 ~ "Private Transit",
                             MODE_AGG==5 ~ "Public Transit",
                             MODE_AGG==6 ~ "School Bus",
                             MODE_AGG==7 ~ "Other"))

modechoice$mode <- factor(modechoice$mode, levels = c("Walk", 
                                                      "Bike", 
                                                      "Private Vehicle", 
                                                      "Private Transit", 
                                                      "Public Transit", 
                                                      "School Bus", 
                                                      "Other"))
## plot boxplot
ggplot(modechoice, aes(x= mode, y= INCOME, fill = mode))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  labs(title="Boxplot of Household Income by Mode Choice", 
       x="Mode Choice", y= "Household Income")+
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

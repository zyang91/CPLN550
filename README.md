## Course Overview
This course provides an overview and introduction to urban transportation planning and policy. 
Although the focus is on US transportation, the course will also pay special attention 
to transportation issues in the fast-growing cities of the developing world. The first section of 
the course focuses on histories and theories of transportation. How and why do we travel? 
How have we gotten where we are today? The next section looks at larger policy questions, 
such as who transportation planning benefits and how we evaluate transportation systems. 
The third section is on 4-step modeling and predicting transportation demand. The final section 
applies what we learn in the first three sections to look at more specific policies, such as 
congestion charging, bicycle planning, and traffic calming. 
 
Throughout the course, I introduce a series of labs and lectures to familiarize you with 
available transportation data and a variety of transportation planning methods. Please be sure 
to download R, R-Studio, and any indicated datasets prior to a lab session. Labs will be 
essential for completing semiweekly homework assignments.
